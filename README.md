(Soon to be) new and improved version of [MyCycle](https://github.com/keziah55/MyCycle).

This GUI centres on the plotting, and uses PyQtGraph to create interactive
plots of my cycling stats.

### To do

- Unit tests

- Compare multiple points

- Personal bests

- Zoom in on month (double click? or tools menu/list?)

- Panel to allow user to set plot parameters?
